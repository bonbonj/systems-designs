			What is Systems Design Styles?
		</h1>
		<p class = "white">
		With the increasing complexity in today’s products, services, or systems, design practitioners have identified the limitation of only using knowledge and methods from one single field. Engineers find it important to take users’ needs into consideration when making design requirements, and designers recognize the value of systematic and quantitative ways of managing the design process.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class = "white">
			It’s hard to be an expert in both designer’s and engineering’s ways of design because both require years of training and practicing to be skillful. But, it is important for both engineers and designers to be aware of the design methods that are complementary to their traditional approaches, and understand the value of these methods. It will be a great advantage if the design practitioner is able to use the proper methods from both fields according to the needs of different design stages.

			<h3>Design Thinking (DT)</h3>
			<h4>Designer’s way of doing design, which empathizes on working with ill-defined problems, understanding user’s needs, ideating for creative solutions, and iterations through quick prototyping.

			<h3>Systems Engineering(SE)</h3>
			<h4>Engineer’s way of doing design, which empathizes on setting design requirements, using quantitative methods for design, optimization, and verifying and validating designs with quantitative methods.</h4>

			<h3>Systems Design Thinking (SDT)</h3>
			<h4>
			The Systems Design Thinking (SDT) framework is proposed as a transdisciplinary power to raise awareness and eliminate bias in attitudes held by designers and engineers. Instead of forming a new way of thinking, this integration allows engineers and designers to see beyond the boundaries of their disciplines, to absorb the cream from other disciplines, and to integrate those into their design approaches.

			<h2>Implications for team-based design</h2>

			<br>
			<p>
			More and more products today include service systems, which requires designers equipped with knowledge from different disciplines, which makes it harder for individual designers to complete the whole design process. A multidisciplinary design team becomes a normal setting in today’s companies.

			Systems Design Thinking (SDT) framework can be applied to facilitate team-based design activities, helping individuals with different backgrounds working together. When working through the whole design process, team members with different strengths can take the lead of each stage.
			According to our four-stage model, those strong at design thinking (DT) are capable of leading the problem identification or ideation stages. People strong at systems engineering are capable of leading the embodiment or verification and validation stages. For those strong at both, they could help cooperate teamwork throughout the whole process.

		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			In addition to thinking style, design skills will be more important in one stage than the other.
			<br>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Problem identification: The most needed skills are understanding user needs (empathy) and looking at the whole picture (holistic thinking).</li>
				<li>Ideation: The most needed skills are thinking creatively for new ideas (creative thinking) and being able to work with ambiguous design problems (ambiguity).</li>
				<li>Embodiment: The most needed skills are doing detailed design with rigid logic (logical thinking) and analyze the design with quantitative methods (analytical thinking).</li>
				<li>Verification & Validation: The most needed skills are checking design requirements and user’s needs (logical thinking) and evaluating the design quantitatively (analytical thinking).</li>
			</ul>
