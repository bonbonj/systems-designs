			<h3>Systems Design Thinker</h3>
			<h4>Systems Design Thinkers have a strong preference for both engineer’s and designer’s design styles. They normally have an interdisciplinary background in both engineering and design fields, which enables them to switch between the two ways of thinking and select proper methods according to the needs of the certain design stage. With a good understanding of both fields, they could be a good coordinator in a multidisciplinary team.</h4>

			<h3>Design Thinker</h3>
			<h4>Design Thinkers prefer creative ways of doing design. They empathize with users when working with ill-defined problems. They understand the user's needs, ideate for creative solutions, and value iterations through quick prototyping. Practitioners of this style, for example, are industrial designers, and UX designers. </h4>

			<h3>Design Thinker +</h3>
			<h4>Design Thinkers + have a stronger preference for Design Thinking. But, they also have relatively high flexibility towards engineering ways of design. Compared with typical Design Thinkers, a better understanding of engineering enables Design Thinker + to have better cooperation with other engineers. Practitioners of this style, for example, are industrial designers in a hi-tech product design team.</h4>

			<h3>Systems Engineer</h3>
			<h4>Systems Engineers prefer an engineer’s way of doing design. They are good at setting design requirements, doing detailed design, optimization, and verifying and validating designs with quantitative methods. They pay great attention to details and tend to depend on data when making design decisions. Practitioners of this style, for example, are engineers designing for large engineering projects. </h4>

			<h3>Systems Engineer +</h3>
			<h4>Systems Engineers + have a stronger preference for an engineer’s way of doing design. But, they also have a relatively high preference for Design Thinking. Comparing with typical Systems Engineers, with flexibility towards the designer’s design style makes Systems Engineer + cooperate better with other designers.
			Practitioners of this style, for example, are engineers doing design for consumer products. </h4>
